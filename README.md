# App Stores Screen Captures Generator

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Every developer of software (utilities, video games) for conventional computers, smartphones, tablets or other devices has at some time been obliged to take screenshots, put them in various formats (file or size), and publish them on their software's listing in one or more application stores.

We're coders, not computer graphics designers, and these occasional manipulations are always more time-consuming and restrictive than they should be.

[App Stores Screen Captures Generator](https://appstoresscreencapturesgenerator.olfsoftware.fr/) aims to eliminate this not very productive phase in the process of publishing our creations.

Developers or testers will continue to take screenshots, but the program will automatically format them.

The list of application stores and image formats is managed as a text file in this repository. Consult the /data folder to learn more and submit any modifications. You can also detail them in a ticket.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
